🔹 TWO POINTERS – REAL LIFE FIRST (Before Any Code)
🧠 Why Two Pointers Exist (Real Life Logic)

Imagine:

You and your friend are searching a book from opposite ends

You start from page 1

Friend starts from last page

You both walk towards each other

Why?
👉 Because meeting in the middle is faster than reading everything twice

This is:

Two Pointers = reduce time by attacking from both sides

🏠 Real Life Scenario 1 – Parents Checking Guests

Guests standing in a line:

A  B  C  D  E  F


Mom checks from left 👉
Dad checks from right 👈
They move inside.

Goal: meet in middle faster

🛒 Real Life Scenario 2 – E-commerce Warehouse

Items arranged by price:

Cheapest on left

Costliest on right

You want to:

pick two items with certain condition
Best way?
👉 one picker from left, one from right

🔥 Tech Scenario (Why Companies Use Two Pointers)

Two pointers are used when:

Data is sorted

Or we need pair comparison

Or we need in-place operation

Or we need min/max from ends

This saves:

Time (O(n) instead of O(n²))

Memory (no extra arrays)

| Question                             | If YES                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Do I have two ends (start + end)?    | Use two pointers         |
| Do pointers move based on condition? | Use `while`              |
| Do I stop when they meet/cross?      | Use `while left < right` |
| Is movement not fixed?               | NEVER use `for`          |


| What you want   | Syntax                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Get element     | `arr[index]`              |
| Loop until meet | `while left < right`      |
| Compare         | `arr[left] == arr[right]` |
| Move pointers   | `left += 1`, `right -= 1` |
