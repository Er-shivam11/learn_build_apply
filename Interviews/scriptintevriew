Hi, I’m Shivam, a Data Engineer with a strong Python and SQL background.
I’ve worked across data pipelines, automation, and backend systems, primarily in production environments.

In my recent role, I built and maintained Python-based ETL workflows, worked with structured and semi-structured data, and optimized SQL queries for reporting and operational use cases.
I’ve handled data ingestion, transformation, validation, and downstream consumption through dashboards and APIs.

I’ve also worked on data quality checks, batch processing, and pipeline monitoring, and collaborated closely with backend and business teams to ensure reliable data delivery.

Earlier in my career, I worked on Python backend systems like OCR automation and transaction workflows, which strengthened my understanding of data correctness, scale, and reliability — all of which directly apply to data engineering.

Right now, my focus is on building scalable, production-grade data pipelines using Python, SQL, and modern data tools, and growing deeper as a Data Engineer

Hi, I’m Shivam. I’ve been working primarily as a Python backend engineer, building production-grade systems using Django and REST APIs.

I started my career with an internship as a Software Engineer, and later joined Data Workstation Pvt Ltd, where I worked on multiple real-world backend systems.

One major project was a track-and-trace automation system for medical packaging, where I built Python services to generate barcodes, automate smart-printer workflows, and manage batch-level inspections using databases and backend logic.

I also worked on document automation using OCR, extracting structured fields from invoices and utility bills and integrating them into backend workflows.

Alongside this, I built a full-stack e-commerce platform where I designed Django REST APIs for product management, authentication, checkout, and payments. I also integrated an AI feature that generated product descriptions from Excel uploads using a generative AI API.

Overall, my strength lies in Python, Django, API design, backend automation, and integrating external services. I enjoy building systems that are reliable, scalable, and production-ready, and
 I’m now looking to grow deeper into backend engineering roles.”
 
 THEN INTERVIWER ASKED ME FEW QUESTION:
 
 In React I use functional components with hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext. 
I structure the app into reusable components.  
For API calls I use axios with interceptors to attach JWT tokens automatically.
I have also worked with routing, props drilling, and lifting state up.


Inheritance: IS-A relationship, reuse behavior from parent class.
Composition: HAS-A relationship, build complex objects by combining simpler ones.
Prefer composition — it gives loose coupling.


1. list1.extend(list2)
2. list1 + list2
3. list1.append(list2)   (nested list)
4. list1 = [*list1, *list2]  (unpacking)
5. import itertools; list(itertools.chain(list1, list2))
