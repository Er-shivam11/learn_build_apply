Snowflake Data Engineer

 

Position Objective

We are looking for a Snowflake Data Engineer with hands-on experience in Snowflake Intelligence, Python-based AI/LLM integrations, and Streamlit. The role involves working with Python code that interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Snowflake data, converting this logic into Snowflake stored procedures or Snowflake-native implementations, and building Streamlit-based user interfaces for AI-driven data insights.

The ideal candidate should have a strong foundation in data engineering along with practical exposure to AI-enabled data workflows.

Key Responsibilities

Snowflake & Data Engineering

Design, develop, and optimize data solutions using the Snowflake Cloud Data Platform
Implement and leverage Snowflake Intelligence capabilities for analytics and AI-driven insights
Develop and optimize complex Snowflake SQL queries
Design and maintain Snowflake stored procedures and Snowflake Scripting
Ensure performance tuning, scalability, and cost optimization in Snowflake
Python, AI & LLM Integration

Work with Python codebases that interact with LLMs (e.g., prompt handling, response processing, embeddings, inference workflows)
Understand and refactor AI/LLM-driven Python logic that includes Snowflake SQL queries
Convert Python-based business and AI logic into:
Snowflake stored procedures, and/or
Snowflake-native implementations using supported frameworks (e.g., Snowflake Scripting, Snowpark)
Validate functional accuracy of AI outputs after conversion or refactoring
Handle prompt orchestration, data pre/post-processing, and AI inference workflows
Streamlit & UI Development

Develop Streamlit applications for AI-driven dashboards, data exploration, and insights
Integrate Streamlit UI with Snowflake and AI/LLM workflows
Build intuitive interfaces for interacting with AI-generated results (summaries, recommendations, insights)
Ensure secure and performant UI design
Collaboration & Best Practices

Collaborate with data scientists, AI engineers, and business stakeholders
Document AI logic, data flows, and Snowflake implementations clearly
Follow best practices for version control, testing, and deployment
Support production deployments and troubleshooting of AI-enabled data solutions
